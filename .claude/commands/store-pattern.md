# Store Pattern "Fixed IconName compilation" - Immediately after solving bugs or discovering patterns

Store important discoveries in Memory MCP for future sessions.

**Usage examples:** `/store-pattern "Fixed compilation error"`

## What it does:

**Quick storage of important discoveries:**

1. **Immediate Storage Triggers:**
   - Bug solutions and compilation fixes
   - New UI patterns or component usage
   - Architectural decisions and rationale
   - Framework-specific patterns discovered
   - Responsive design solutions
   - Performance optimizations

2. **Storage Format:**
   - Create focused entities (3-5 observations max)
   - Use atomic, actionable observations
   - Connect to existing entities via relations
   - Avoid verbose debugging details

3. **Auto-categorization:**
   - **Architecture:** High-level decisions and patterns
   - **Component Library:** UI patterns and API usage
   - **Process:** Development workflow and testing
   - **Bug Solution:** Specific problem-solution pairs

## Quick Examples:

```bash
/store-pattern "Fixed compilation by adding mut self"
/store-pattern "Responsive layout needs Width::fill()"  
/store-pattern "NovyUI buttons use IconName tokens"
/store-pattern "Height::screen() + Height::fill() pattern"
```

**Perfect timing:**
- Right after fixing a compilation error
- When you discover a new component pattern
- After solving a layout/responsive issue
- When you figure out framework-specific behavior
- After making architectural decisions
